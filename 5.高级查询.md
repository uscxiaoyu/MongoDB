<b> Query Embedded Documents </b>

<b>Query Exact Matches on Embedded Documents</b>

The following operation returns documents in the bios collection where the embedded document name is exactly `{ first: "Yukihiro", last: "Matsumoto" }`, including the order:
```javascript
> db.bios.find(
    {
      name: {
              first: "Yukihiro",
              last: "Matsumoto"
            }
    }
)
>
```
The name field must match the embedded document exactly. The query does not match documents with the following name fields:
```javascript
{
   first: "Yukihiro",
   aka: "Matz",
   last: "Matsumoto"
}
```
<b> Query Fields of an Embedded Document </b>

The following operation returns documents in the bios collection where the embedded document name contains a field first with the value "Yukihiro" and a field last with the value "Matsumoto". The query uses dot notation to access fields in an embedded document:
```javascript
> db.bios.find(
... {"name.first":"Yukihiro",
... "name.last":"Matsumoto"}).pretty()
{
	"_id" : 8,
	"name" : {
		"first" : "Yukihiro",
		"aka" : "Matz",
		"last" : "Matsumoto"
	},
	"birth" : ISODate("1965-04-14T04:00:00Z"),
	"contribs" : [
		"Ruby"
	],
	"awards" : [
		{
			"award" : "Award for the Advancement of Free Software",
			"year" : "2011",
			"by" : "Free Software Foundation"
		}
	]
}

```
The query matches the document where the name field contains an embedded document with the field first with the value "Yukihiro" and a field last with the value "Matsumoto". For instance, the query would match documents with name fields that held either of the following values:
```javascript
{
  first: "Yukihiro",
  aka: "Matz",
  last: "Matsumoto"
}

```
